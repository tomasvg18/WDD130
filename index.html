<p>Hello! I'm majoring in CIT and hoping to switch to Cyber Security when the major comes out. I enjoy fishing, shooting and playing video games on my computer.I am married to my loving Wife Quinn, we got married here in Rexburg in August 2023. I see a great advantage in learning more about web design will greatly help me in my understanding of how wedbsites and HTML and CSS works. This can help me better secure web assets. </p> 
<p>I've been a member on paper my whole life, but I fell away at a young age and just recently found my faith again about 4 years ago. The church has changed my life in unimaginable ways and has enabled me to overcome old habits and sins. I'm so grateful for the church and all the spiritual and educational benefits it offers me. </p>
